Q/A

Q: Why is the game vertical, not horizontal like classic Pong?
A: Make use of the screen real-estate on mobile without having to turn the phone. 

Q: Why not use a game library/engine
A: I haven't really worked with any and wanted to keep the project as simple as possible, same goes for Express and is static files.
