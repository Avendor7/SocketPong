Socket Pong external documentation

Q/A

Q: Why is the game vertical, not horizontal like classic Pong?
A: Make use of the screen real-estate on mobile without having to turn the phone. 

Q: Why not use a game library/engine
A: I haven't really worked with any and wanted to keep the project as simple as possible, same goes for Express and is static files.






AI with server
    all logic is client side, but the server can send its paddle x and y based on ball location

client sends ball location, server sends paddle x and y coordinates back and moves appropriatly
if the ball collides with a paddle, it bounces back, if it doesn't and goes past the paddle, score is increased. 

Should probably have a key or HTML button that resets the scores, starts and stops the game, etc. Probably in the header or footer of the game
