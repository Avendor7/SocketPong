Socket Pong external documentation

Q/A

Q: Why is the game vertical, not horizontal like classic Pong?
A: Make use of the screen real-estate on mobile without having to turn the phone. 

Q: Why not use a game library/engine
A: I haven't really worked with any and wanted to keep the project as simple as possible, same goes for Express and is static files.


Known Bugs

scores aren't entirely centre - need to be adjusted to the centre, not top left



AI with server
    all logic is client side, but the server can send its paddle x and y based on ball location

client sends ball location, server sends paddle x and y coordinates back and moves appropriatly
if the ball collides with a paddle, it bounces back, if it doesn't and goes past the paddle, score is increased. 

Should probably have a key or HTML button that resets the scores, starts and stops the game, etc. Probably in the header or footer of the game\



TODO:

1. rewrite the component function, separating the ball and the paddle code 
2. make sure bouncing of the ball and collision is working between paddles and the ball

3. send ball data to server - make sure it receives it ok
4. Add AI based on the location of the ball - set x and y of leftPaddle
5. send 'increase score' to the server based on a hit or miss with paddles
6. send client updated scores
7. add buttons to restart, stop, start game
8. polish everything up - including internal documentation
9. set up letsencrypt on digital ocean server
10. clone game to server, run with PM2
11. Nginx proxy to PM2
12. write out external documentation - things to do differently, future additions
